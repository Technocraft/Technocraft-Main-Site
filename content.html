<h1>Factions map reset!</h1>
<p><strong>[EDIT]: Faction map has been reset! Hope you all enjoy :D</strong></p>
<p>We'll be resetting the faction map this weekend!<br />
On friday we'll have a massive pvp event!<br />
With the map reset we will also introduce some other changes, we will remove fly from donators, and we will revamp the kits!
